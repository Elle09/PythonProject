Smart Personal Finance Analyzer - Project Checklist


I am aware that I did not complete this project as planned. I have had trouble balancing some life/work issues the past month. 
It's not an excuse but partially a reason. 
I did enjoy the learning materials from this class, and had a fun time applying what I've learned (and learning things a different way than I initially understood) and I am proud of what I did accomplish here.

I still plan to finish this project because I enjoyed it and want the UI working.

Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this class these past few months. Although it makes me sad, I understand I can no longer be apart of the class since I did not complete this project on time. 

Thank you to everyone who contributed their time for me and my peers to learn something new.
